    <p>AI advances are categorised by their capacity to imitate human characteristics, the innovation they utilize to do this, their real-world applications, and the hypothesis of intellect, which weâ€™ll talk about in more profundity below. Using these characteristics for reference, all fake insights frameworks - genuine and speculative - drop into one of three sorts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which has a narrow range of abilities</li>
        <li>Artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is on par with human capabilities</li>
        <li>Artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is more capable than a human</li>
    </ol>
